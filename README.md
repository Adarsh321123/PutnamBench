# PutnamBench

PutnamBench is a benchmark for evaluation of theorem-proving algorithms on competition mathematics problems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition years 1962 - 2023. Our formalizations currently support three formal languages : Lean 4 $\land$ Isabelle $\land$ Coq. PutnamBench comprises of 1697 manually-crafted formalizations, aggregated over all languages.

PutnamBench aims to support research in automated mathematical reasoning by providing a multilingual benchmark for evaluating theorem-proving algorithms. It is released under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 for Lean 4 and Isabelle, MIT for Coq). The informal statements are also available with permission from the MAA.

We strongly encourage community feedback! Please let us know if you have any comments for improving PutnamBench. If you notice any mistakes, please raise an issue on the repository and we will address it. We kindly ask that you do not write formal proofs for any of the problems in an effort to reduce contamination.
